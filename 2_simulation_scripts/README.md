# Simulation and analysis: major steps and scripts

1. linker_loop_modeling_scripts/

The simulation construct consists of two complete monomers and only the two hub domains of the neighborly packed monomers within the dodecamer. The initial construct for CamK2d was extract from PDB: 8USO (see camk2d/ABCD_truncated_clean.pdb), and the one for CamK2a was extract PDB:3SOA (see camk2a/a-tetra-organize.pdb)

The missing loops and linkers were then built using Modeller based on the full sequence, for example, see *_generate.py and *_build.py

2. system_set_up/
   minimization_and_equilibration/
   simulation_production/

The models derived from Modeller were solvated using CHARMM GUI (https://www.charmm-gui.org/). The fully solvatned systems can be found under directory system_set_up/. All equilibration and production simulations were performed using the standard protocol as generated by CHARMM GUI using 
2. Conditions: 
    terminals (ACE CT2)
    box size (130 angstrom)
    ion (NaCl 200mM)
    TIP3P water
3. The systems generated with CHARMMGUI containing the protein, ion and water can be found in this folder under current folder: system_set_up

## The simulation production under equilibrated conddition is run with GROMACS

1. Tool: GROMACS 2019.4
2. The scripts for energy minimization and equilibration and the output system infomation can be find in this folder under current folder: minimization_and_equilibration
3. The scripts for production and structures after simulation production of equilibrated state can be found in this folder under current folder: camk2_production/
    eg: the structure of camk2d-exon18 after one equilibration production: camk2_production/camk2d/exon18/18_s1_400k.gro

## Analyze of the RMSD, RMSF and pairwise distance are done with GROMACS

The scripts for the analysis can be found in this folder under current folder: camk2_trj_analysis
