# Simulation and analysis: major steps and scripts

------
linker_loop_modeling/<br>

The simulation construct consists of two complete monomers and only the two hub domains of the neighborly packed monomers within the dodecamer. The initial construct for CamK2d was extract from PDB: 8USO (see camk2d/ABCD_truncated_clean.pdb), and the one for CamK2a was extract PDB:3SOA (see camk2a/a-tetra-organize.pdb)

The missing loops and linkers were then built using Modeller based on the full sequence, for example, see *_generate.py and *_build.py

The models derived from Modeller were solvated using CHARMM GUI (https://www.charmm-gui.org/). The fully solvatned systems can be found under directory system_set_up/. All equilibration and production simulations were performed using the standard protocol as generated by CHARMM GUI using GROMACS 2019.4. Sample scripts for all stages are provided for each construct. The final snapshots (*.gro) are also provided for each stage.

Sample scripts for RMSD, RMSF and pairwise distance analysis.
