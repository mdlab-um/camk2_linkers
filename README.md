# Atomistic simulations of linker effects in CaMKII

This depository contains structural models, simulation and analysis scripts, and MD trajetory movies as part of the study titled "A domain-swapped CaMKII conformation facilitates linker-mediated allosteric regulation" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.24.586494v1). 

Atomistic simulations were ultilized to model the structure and interaction of dynamic linkers of CaMKII variants and understand the effects of linker on the open-close equilibrium of the CaMKII holoenzyme.

Specificially,

1_tructure models/ 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  initial structural models derived from Modeller<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  the last snapshots of MD simulations at 400 K.  

2_simulation_scripts/

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  All steps including loop modeling, simulation and analysis scripts.  
  
3_trajectory_movies/ 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  movies from representative trajectories of each construct.

See README within each directory for additional information.
