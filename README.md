This depository contains structural models, simulation and analysis scripts and MD trajetory movies as part of the study titled "A domain-swapped CaMKII conformation facilitates linker-mediated allosteric regulation" (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.03.24.586494v1). 

Atomistic simulations were ultilized to model the structure and interaction of dynamic linkers of CaMKII variants and understand the effects of linker on the open-close equilibrium of the CaMKII holoenzyme.

Specificially,

1_tructure models/: 
  initial structural models derived from Modeller
  the last snapshots of MD simulations at 400 K.  

2_simulation_scripts: including the loop modeling, simulation and analysis scripts.  
  
3_trajectory_movies: The representative movies from trajectories.
